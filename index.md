<p class="describe-text">A little about myself</p>
<br>
I’m all about living life to the fullest! Whether it’s jumping into a new sport, meeting new people, or getting hooked on a great book or show, I’m always in for the adventure. And, yep, I love to sing—doesn’t matter if it’s in the shower or with friends, I’m all about the music. 

On the tech side, I’m like a kid in a candy store. Machine learning, IoT, networks, systems, and computer vision? Bring it on! I get a kick out of experimenting with new ideas and figuring out how things work. For me, tech isn’t just a career—it’s a playground where I can learn, create, and have a blast while doing it.
